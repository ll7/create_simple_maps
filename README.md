# Create Simple Maps

Create simple maps that only display the building outlines based on open street map maps:

## Download a map

Go to <openstreetmap.org> and select the area you want to download. Click on the export button and save the map as a .svg file. Use the `Scale=1:1` option. Use the custom dimensions and remember them.
